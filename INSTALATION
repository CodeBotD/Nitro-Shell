## 🚀 Install NitroShell (macOS Only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeBotD/Nitro-Shell.git ~/.nitroshell
chmod +x ~/.nitroshell/shell.sh

🔧 Setup .zshrc

Open your ZSH config:

nano ~/.zshrc

Paste this at the bottom:

# NitroShell by CodeBotD 🚀
alias nitro="~/.nitroshell/shell.sh"
alias cmds="say 'NitroShell activated' && nitro"

command_not_found_handler() {
  local cmd="$1"
  echo "zsh: command not found: $cmd"
  echo "NitroShell: Thinking... 🤔"

  local all_cmds=$(echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | xargs -I {} find {} -maxdepth 1 -type f -perm +111 2>/dev/null | xargs -n 1 basename | sort -u)

  local suggestion=$(python3 - <<EOF
import difflib
commands = """$all_cmds""".split()
matches = difflib.get_close_matches("$cmd", commands, n=1, cutoff=0.5)
print(matches[0] if matches else "")
EOF
)

  if [[ -n "$suggestion" ]]; then
    echo "NitroShell: Did you mean '$suggestion'? [Y/n]: "
    read -k1 answer
    echo ""
    if [[ "$answer" == [Yy] || "$answer" == "" ]]; then
      echo "🧠 NitroShell is running: $suggestion"
      eval "$suggestion"
    else
      echo "❌ Cancelled."
    fi
  else
    echo "NitroShell: I scrambled my brain and found nothing 🧠💥"
  fi
}

Save (CTRL+O, Enter) and exit (CTRL+X).

Then reload your shell:

source ~/.zshrc

✅ Use NitroShell

    Start it manually:

nitro

    Or say the magic word:

cmds

    Test a typo:

ecoh

You'll see:

zsh: command not found: ecoh  
NitroShell: Did you mean 'echo'? [Y/n]
